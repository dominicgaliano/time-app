# Clock App

Partially completed clock app that allows for timezone selection.

TODO:

- Fix modal styles
  - Modal changes width based on selected timezone
    - I believe this will require internal styling of the `<Select />` element
- Convert time display to monospace font (currently, it is shifting the position on small displays)
- Fix TS type errors (low priority, external package types that are not documented sufficiently. Code still runs (seemingly) correctly.)
